APIs that provide undo and redo behavior for operations that manipulate
the workspace. 
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
This package contains APIs for the Eclipse Platform User Interface that
support the undo and redo of operations that manipulate the workspace.
Undoable operations that create, delete, move, and copy resources are 
provided.
<p>
The typical usage pattern is that a client creates one of the concrete operations
and executes it using the platform operation history.  For example, the following
snippet deletes the project "Blort" without deleting its contents, and adds it
to the operation history so that it can be undone and redone.
</p>
<pre>
IProject project = getWorkspace().getRoot().getProject("Blort");
// assume that getMonitor() returns a suitable progress monitor
project.create(getMonitor());
project.open(getMonitor());
DeleteResourcesOperation op = new DeleteResourcesOperation(
	new IResource[] { project }, "Delete Project Blort", false);
PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getOperationSupport()
	.getOperationHistory().execute(operation, getMonitor(), null);
</pre>
