Action states depend on the selection in a viewer. 
The PasteAction defined by EMF, can only paste if it can add the copied item into the Selection as a containment. 
This mechanism is not working well on a tableviewer, where
we can't select the container for a child element. (The table viewer doesn't
show the parent element). Also pasting a reference is likely not working

Note that the command creation (i.e. for a paste command) is delegated to
the ItemProvider.
