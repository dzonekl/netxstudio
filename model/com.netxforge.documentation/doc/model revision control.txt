Models can be migrated by: 

1 Create a new version of the model
===================================

- To have unique instances of our models (Both .xsd and .ecore) do a save-as for both in the migrations folder. 
- Update the target namespace of the source model (.xsd). Keep the file name as this would otherwise also rename the .ecore
- Update references to the new target name space in other .xsd's. 
- Reload the .genmodel
- Don't regenerate the code yet. We would need to migrate the old model first.

- Generate the code.
- Update the model URI wherever used. (Like in the .edit plugin).


2 Create a model transformation
===============================

- In our model transformation folder, define a new transformation for this model. 


3 Migrate the existing model
============================
- Save the existing model to a file. 
- Apply the model transfmoration
