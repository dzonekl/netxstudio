Conversion of the NetXForge web to Rails 3. 
============================================

This lazydog describes the conversion of the Instiki system to version 3 of Rails. 
Better instiki site: 
http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/wiki/instiki/show/HomePage

1. Use a rails 3 generated app to compare. [SOLVED]
2. Replace the /scripts with the generate /scripts content.[SOLVED]
3.
3.1 created application.rb (Rails 3.  has an application.rb), [SOLVED]

Load the /lib's  as this is turned off. 
- config.autoload_paths << "#{Rails.root}/lib"
Additionally load all sub directories, as another error occured later on (see further down). 


3.2 copied in the environements/ and initializers/ from template. [ONGOING]
move the original environment.rb out of the way. Some migrations: 
- rexml_versions => Not sure what to do with this. It scans various directories to get an REXML version. Why not

- require_dependency 'instiki_errors' => Moved this to a custom initializer. 
- *.stuff migration??
 
put a version requirement in GemFile and that's it? 
3.3 Copied in boot.rb , remove preinitializer.rb which is a pre Rails 3 hack to get bundler working. [SOLVED]
See: http://gembundler.com/v1.3/rails23.html

4. problem with plugin: protect_forms_from_spam, comment it out. Find an alternative [TODO]
5. Deal with assets. [ONGOING]


- Update the Gemfile to include: 

# Gems used only for assets and not required
# in production environments by default.
group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'

  # See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes
  # gem 'therubyracer', :platforms => :ruby

  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
end

- (Created /app/assets/stylsheet,javascript,images), copied assets in there. 
- Application.js is auto created, but we already have an Application.js file with a bit of scripts in it, 
so add manifest information. 
- Copy in Application.css

See this for info on assets: 

- use image_tag helper methods. 
- rename .css to .css.erb to use for example: 
<%= asset_path 'netxforge-tail.png' %>




6. route definitions: [SOLVED]
- root: ID can't be specified. so adapted the public controller to set to default 'HomePage'
- migrated wiki admin routes: 

  match 'create_system', :to => 'admin#create_system'
  match 'create_web', :to => 'admin#create_web'
  match 'delete_web', :to => 'admin#delete_web'
  match 'delete_files', :to => 'admin#delete_files'
  match 'web_list', :to => 'wiki#web_list'
  
- migrate web links
:requirements is now called constraints. 
- migrate method ro produce a route, if the DEFAULT_WEB is set. 

         root  /                                                 public#page {:id=>"HomePage"}
create_system  /create_system(.:format)                          admin#create_system
   create_web  /create_web(.:format)                             admin#create_web
   delete_web  /delete_web(.:format)                             admin#delete_web
 delete_files  /delete_files(.:format)                           admin#delete_files
     web_list  /web_list(.:format)                               wiki#web_list

               /:web/remove_orphaned_pages_in_category(.:format) admin#remove_orphaned_pages_in_category
               /:web/file/delete/:id(.:format)                   file#delete {:id=>nil}

               /:web/file_list/:sort_order(.:format)             wiki#file_list {:sort_order=>nil}
               /:web/import/:id(.:format)                        file#import
               /:web/login(.:format)                             wiki#login
               /:web/web_list(.:format)                          wiki#web_list
               /:web/show/diff/:id(.:format)                     wiki#show {:mode=>"diff", :requirements=>{:id=>/.+/}}
               /:web/revision/diff/:id/:rev(.:format)            wiki#revision {:rev=>/\d+/, :id=>/.+/, :mode=>"diff"}
               /:web/revision/:id/:rev(.:format)                 wiki#revision {:rev=>/\d+/, :id=>/.+/}
               /:web/source/:id/:rev(.:format)                   wiki#source {:rev=>/\d+/, :id=>/.+/}
               /:web/list/:category(.:format)                    wiki#list {:category=>nil}
               /:web/recently_revised/:category(.:format)        wiki#recently_revised {:requirements=>{:category=>/.*/}, :category=>nil}
               /:web/:action/:id(.:format)                       wiki#:action {:id=>/.+/}
               /:web/:action(.:format)                           wiki#:action
               /:web(.:format)                                   wiki#index


7. replace @controller with controller wherever this was required. [SOLVED]
8. Fix issues with rendering and default.layout/ [SOLVED]
# DEBUG: Render an action without the layout for troubleshooting: render :layout => false
fix the layout content insertion point, was @content_for_layout versus modern yield. so => <%= yield %>

Use: <%= debug params %>

9. problem with sublayout: (Wiki source) [TODO] 
 Showing /Users/Christophe/Documents/Spaces/netxforge_aptana/com.netxforge.store/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb where line #46 raised:

undefined method `sub_layout' for #<WikiController:0x007ffb07b5bf58>

10. link_to_remote issues: (TODO, now workaround, not using the :update tag). [TODO]

Currently URL's like this are generated, which embeds a js into the URL with onclick statement). 

<a onclick="new Ajax.Updater('intropage', '/public/page/features?menu=true&partial=true', 
{asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true}); return false;" href="#"></a>

:update is not supported anymore in Rails 3. (AJAX call back to update a DOM id), see the following articles: 

http://www.simonecarletti.com/blog/2010/06/unobtrusive-javascript-technique/

New approach is based on separation of the HTML and JS, so the JS should do the update. 

11. Issues with form_tag[SOLVED]
in template edit.html.erb, the form tag starts with '<%' erb shabang, but should be '<%=' 
replacing this fixed the problem. 

See 3.0 Release notes, section 7.4.2.

Note: The included javascript should be moved to the application.js

12. Validation Errors. [SOLVED]

As we moved environment.rb out of the way, we discarded: 

require_dependency 'instiki_errors'

defined with :  
/lib/instiki_errors.rb   

Decided to put the requirement in an initializer under: 
config/initializers/instiki_errors.rb 

# Load the Instiki Errors
require 'instiki_errors'

Note: Not using require_dependency, as this is undocumented (Rails internal) and for development only. Not really a requirement here 
I believe. 

13.ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity erros on various model objects[SOLVED]
because of this:  
https://gist.github.com/peternixey/1978249

Add (example): 

# Needed in Rails 3. 
  attr_accessible :locked_at, :locked_by

in various model objects, to fix these errors. 
Page =>  attr_accessible :locked_at, :locked_by, :name
Revision=> attr_accessible :revised_at, :page, :content, :author

.....

14. undefined method error in WikiContent[SOLVED]
It turned out, that  

include ChunkManager (in wiki_content.rb) didbn't load properly, as 
ChunkManager has dependencies on various other classes in /chunks. 
Made sure these are loaded in application.rb (See bullet 3.1) 

however this causes another issue: 

14.1 Error, when include /lib/chunks
Expected /Users/Christophe/Documents/Spaces/netxforge_aptana/com.netxforge.store/lib/chunks/wiki.rb to define Wiki
Actually the whole app now fails with different errors: 

This could be a conflict in naming of classes, as /chunks defines a wiki.rb
See this post: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10948779/expected-to-define-when-calling-class-inside-a-module

fixed by: 

- renamed wiki to wiki_c and references to it. 
- removed call to html_safe in WikiContent.render! as this points to a method which 
will produce a ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer instance from the WikiContent, so not adhering to the instance type, 
this gived method_errors

15. URL generator in wiki gives wrong urls for: [TODO] 
- all Pages => /:web/list/HomePage (So the :page is appended and shou'd not). 
- edit Web => /:web/edit_web/HomePage (:page appended, should not). 


16. Dealing with XML templates. [SOLVED]
renamed atom.rxml to atom.builder simply solved the problem. 

17. When using in production the following error: [ONGOING]

Processing by PublicController#page as HTML
  Parameters: {"id"=>"HomePage"}
  Rendered public/page.html.erb within layouts/application (243.4ms)
Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 376ms

ActionView::Template::Error (prototype.js isn't precompiled):
    21: 		<meta name="verify-v1" content="yKzHNy4vPBYl3Bi3DH5frO5UQDFjgOFJPc/4/Wznb3o=" />
    22: 		<title><%= @title %></title>
    23: 
    24: 		<%= javascript_include_tag "prototype" %>
    25: 		<%= javascript_include_tag "slider" %>
    26: 		<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'style' %>
    27: 	</head>
  app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:24:in `_app_views_layouts_application_html_erb__537070538_78133640'

According to Rails doc: 
Turn of the asset pipeline: 

config.assets.enabled = false

or compile: 

bundle exec rake assets:precompile

(See point 5. fixed asset pipeline for production). 

Still a problem....


 
18. You don't need to install rails_xss as a plugin for Rails 3 and after. [TODO]

http://simianarmy.com/post/11117853564/upgrading-to-rails-3-rails-xss
- What to do with this? 

19. [2013-03-13 12:26:00] WARN  Could not determine content-length of response body. Set content-length of the response or set Response#chunked = true

Caused by webrick server. 

20. Problems running rake on the server: [SOLVED]

20.1 You have already activated rake 10.0.3, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.9.2.2. Using bundle exec may solve this.
=> Fixed by running 'bundle update rake'
20.2Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs for a list of available runtimes.
Need to install nodejs

sudo apt-get install python-software-properties python g++ make
OK
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
OK
sudo apt-get update
OK
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
OK

21 App doesn't start with passenger: 
Error message:

As we use RVM, we need to deal with different GemSets etc...
