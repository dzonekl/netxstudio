Model observations
---------------------------

Company

Company should be vendor? (It’s also used for standard bodies so should be kept generic). 
Add Company short name.

Element 

Present separate worksheet for Function, Equipment (Abstract = false) and instance of an Equipment.  
Decided to split element definition for functional and equipment. The equipment definition will link to the functional definition. (In the model currently, 
the equipment definition can be linked as a contained element, TODO Decide how to create an 
equipment from an element (Copy content). 

For element/resources/parameters definition reference to standards document needed. (i.e. SGSN from 3GPP TS 23.060), an additional field is needed. 

Equipment
As an example SGSN9810 from Huawei, consider also the SW release version. 
V800R007 (Check with specialist). 

Boards have sometimes fixed slot locations, consider modeling this not as a resource, but as a specific HW resource.  

Resource
Not done yet, we need an overview of used counters (to derive the monitored resources). 


Measurement (PI). 

TODO define this new model object. 


Counter
TODO define this new model object. 
Vendor specific Defined on Equipment level, but would point to an inherited functional definition.
