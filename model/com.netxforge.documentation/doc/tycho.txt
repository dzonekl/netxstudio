Run tycho for our releng product: 
--------------------------------

mvn clean install -e -f releng.tycho/com.netxforge.releng/pom.xml

Warnings (Cached local builds): 
-------------------------------

Sometime build fails when trying to use locally build artifacts. 
See: 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=355367
 
 NetXStudio experienced it when some artifacts were removed from the build, but still
 resolved locally. 
 
 [WARNING] The following locally built units have been used to resolve project dependencies:
[WARNING]   org.eclipse.ui.ide/3.9.0
[WARNING]   com.netxforge.models.06032012.emf/1.0.0.201403240111

For example the last plugin here was removed from the pom.xml for build, but still it is 
included! Compilation fails with this plugin. (This generated EMF plugin is non-native CDO which is needed 
for certain builds, as dependents use import and the same package name exists for various model implementations 
it gets picked up!. We can't have that. 


The workaround: 

As a workaround, you can delete the file that contains the list of locally built artifacts: ~/.m2/repository/.meta/p2-local-metadata.properties

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Target_Platform#Locally_built_artifacts


Non expected dependencies: 
----------------------------


Here is a list of cache locations that may have been involved in your scenario, and how to clear them

    Target folder: If the target folder contain results from a previous build, this data may be used by a Maven build to speed up the build. Tycho doesn't make use of this feature, and AFAIK it shouldn't pick up anything existing from the target folder.

    To be sure, always include the clean goal in your mvn calls.

    Local Maven repository: In order to support builds of parts of a reactor, Tycho adds artifacts that have been built locally with mvn clean install to the target platform. If you are not aware of this feature, this can have various strange effects.

    To avoid this, don't build with install unless you have to. Use mvn clean verify instead. Also: Deleting the file ~/.m2/repository/.meta/p2-local-metadata.properties resets what Tycho considers to be "locally installed".

    Since Tycho 0.16.0, you can also disable this behaviour for one build through the command line switch -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore or for all builds by setting the same property in the settings.xml.

    p2: The p2 update manager in Eclipse caches p2 repositories it has used since the start of Eclipse.

    To force p2 to reload a repository, go to Preferences > Install/Update > Available Software Sites, select a repository and hit Reload. The repositories will also be reloaded if you re-start Eclipse.
