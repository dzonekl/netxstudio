Run tycho for our releng product: 
--------------------------------

mvn clean install -e -f releng.tycho/com.netxforge.releng/pom.xml

Warnings (Cached local builds): 
-------------------------------

Sometime build fails when trying to use locally build artifacts. 
See: 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=355367
 
 NetXStudio experienced it when some artifacts were removed from the build, but still
 resolved locally. 
 
 [WARNING] The following locally built units have been used to resolve project dependencies:
[WARNING]   org.eclipse.ui.ide/3.9.0
[WARNING]   com.netxforge.models.06032012.emf/1.0.0.201403240111

For example the last plugin here was removed from the pom.xml for build, but still it is 
included! Compilation fails with this plugin. (This generated EMF plugin is non-native CDO which is needed 
for certain builds, as dependents use import and the same package name exists for various model implementations 
it gets picked up!. We can't have that. 


The workaround: 

As a workaround, you can delete the file that contains the list of locally built artifacts: ~/.m2/repository/.meta/p2-local-metadata.properties
