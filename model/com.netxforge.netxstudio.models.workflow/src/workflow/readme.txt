This plugin contains workflows to generate 

- Documentation of the model. (Note, we have a hard reference to the .ecore model files). 
- Import templates for the model. 


The plugin contains some specific java extensions, which could not be done by xtend. 

The following versions of M2T & Workflow (MWE) is needed.
