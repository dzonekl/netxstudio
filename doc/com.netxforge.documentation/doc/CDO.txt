Making packages CDO enabled
===========================

There are two options: 

1) CDO Native
 - Create an EMF project, and use the CDO Native Importer. (Instead of i.e. XSD). 

2) EMF Gen model migration. 

Use the option "migrate EMF model" under the CDO context menu. 

Programming a client
====================





Setting up a server with derby: 
===============================

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Setting_up_a_CDO_Server

1) Checkout the server product from: 
- It's part of the Eclipse modeling distro, so no need to download. 

2) Save the CDO-Server.xml config file to /home/yoda/configuration/cdo-server.xml
Note: The provided server config is not correct: 

-Change the mapping property to "horizontal" instead of "horizontalBranching". 
- Uncomment the Derby DB Adapter

Note: The location of the derby DB file is by default /temp/cdodb1
On win32 it will end up in the root (C: or D:). Perhaps better to specify it in 
a runtime folder. 


3) Settings in launch configuration

- Add the required plugins + 

* org.apache.derby
* org.eclipse.emf.cdo.server.db
* org.eclipse.net4j.db.derby
* org.eclipse.net4j.tcp

to work with Derby. 
The total number of plugins is now 36

- Change the net4j.config property to: 

-Dnet4j.config=${resource_loc:/org.eclipse.emf.cdo.server.product/rootfiles/configuration}

4) Enable tracing on CDO and Net4J

5) Close the server by typing: "close" in the OSGI console. 

Connect with a client
=====================


1) Open the CDO Sessions view Window->Show View->CDO

2) Create a session / connection: 
- Press + 
- fill in: 
Server description: tcp://localhost or tcp://[ip address]:2036 
Repo name: repo1 // This is the default repository name in cdoserver.xml
	
3) Adding packages. 

- You can add packages:


Troubleshooting:
================

Stop / restart server can give an error:
