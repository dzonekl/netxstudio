h1. Package information

----------

With this package, we refactor the reporting logic, target emission (i.e. xls with POI). 

- Emitting logic accepts IReportEmitter implementations. 
- Emitting logic needs an IStreamProducer for where to emit the report. 


h2. What we can't do yet: 

- The emitter implementation is "coded" instead of declaration based like an XML format or template.
- The emitting order and what is emitted is a procedure in the doRun() method of the emitting logic. 
- The data to emitt is set and extracted by the Emitting logic, very hardcoded as well. 

h2. What we could do: 

- Base the data on datasets which can be composed based on a DSL or simply code. The DTP data set is very 
JDBC, SQL based which we don't want so we need to 'skin' it to it's minimum. We will have a fixed data source, 
which is EMF/CDO.

- The report is 'design' with a report designer which produces the DSL for the report format. (Re-use BIRT format). 
- The report designers 'tighs' in the data sets.
