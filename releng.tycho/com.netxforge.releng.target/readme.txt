OSS2 Version 1: 
---------------

Driven by NetXStudio Requirements, so this is an RCP Client application with needs for GEF, Xtext (2.3.1), Nebula, MWE, Xpand, Xtend, 
EMF and CDO. Build on the Eclipse Kepler release. There a few Eclipse bundles which we hacked as well, and finally there are feature definitions
to group NetXStudio and 3rd party bundles for optimized minimal number of dependencies in the end products. 

OSS2 Version 2: 
---------------


This is very much about the implementation of a web based UI, but still using many underlying server modules. 
It adds the Springframework to OSS2
