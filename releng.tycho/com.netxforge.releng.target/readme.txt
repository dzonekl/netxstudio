- The local target should not be checked in, but used for easy management 
and migration to a full P2 URL .target (Plugins can be compared in case of compilation/runtime errors). 

- The shared (Stored) target is based on Eclipse simulteanous releases.

- Some local repo's also, will expose through our Apache Server as HTTP URL's. 
the target is netxstudio_kepler_self_managed.
