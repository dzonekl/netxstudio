h1. Data Structure and principles

The system data structure consists of the following items: 

* Library
* Operator(s)
* Services
* Metrics
* Geo

h2. Library

The resource library is the base data of the system. It defines the Telecommunications representation of system and it's characteristics. 

It is the primary starting point to use NetXStudio and is populated in the Library Task.

The following objects are defined in the Library.  

* Network Element Type
* Function
* Equipment
* Company
* Tolerance
* Unit
* Expression
* Resource
* Metric

In the diagram below, as an example we provide a definition of a system named as  MSC-S. 

# The objects highlighted in Yellow, represent objects in the Network
# The objects highlighted in Purple, represent objects in the Library

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Function
* Equipment


h3. Metric

A metric is an identifier with a name which refers to a statistics counter produced by a telecommunication equipment 
vendor. Metrics should be defined for each relevant capacity metric required to be monitored. A Metric is referenced by 
a metric source. 

h3. Resource

Resource contain various so-called ranges, which store information about the resource. 
These are: 

* Multiple Metric Ranges

* Capacity Range

* Utilization Range

!PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/img/getting_started/resource_structure.png!

Metric ranges are created when reading metrics from the defined sources. A metric source 
will tell for each metric and corresponding resource the characteristics of the metric being stored in the resource. 
The characteristics are: 

- Are these Average or Busy Hour values, identified as AVG and BH
- What is the interval of measurement in minutes. I.e an interval of '60' means an interval of one hour between each measurement. 

Example: 

For a metric which produces hourly busy hour value, the following metric range will be created in the resource. 

METRIC BH 60 (This is actually the syntax used by the NetXScript expression grammar).

h3. Metric vs Resource what is the difference? 

It can be confusing the see the difference between a metric and a resource. 
The difference should be become clear considering the following. 

A Resource is holding the values of a metric, but also the results of calculations like the utilization or the tolerance values. In contrary a metric, is specified by the vendor of the telecommunications equipment.

A Resource is created when reading-in metric values, The name of the resource is giben the name of the metric.
A resource can however also be created manually and populated with the results from expressions. This is also referred
to as a derived resource.   


h2. Design Task

The following objects are defined in the Design Task.  

* Network
* Network Element
* Functional Relationship 
* Physical Relationship

h3. Operator

The operator, is the actual model of the Operator
 
h3. Network

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Network
* Function
* Equipment

It also holds the Functional and Physical relationships. 

h3. Network Element

The Network Element object is the instance of a Library Network Element Type.



h3. Lifecycle 

Network Elements, Equipments and Functions all have a lifecycle represented by various dates. 

* Proposed => The object creation date in the system. 
* Planned => The expected planning date, meaning confirmation that the object will be actually introduced into the network.  
* Construction => The date the object is actually constructed in reality. 
* In Service => The date the object is brought into service. 
* Out of Service => The date the object is no more in service. 

Lifecycle rules. 

The Lifecycle dates are relevant to various processes. 

* Objects have to be "In Service" to be included in the monitoring cycle.  


h2. Geographical

The following objects are currently also defined for the network, but not in use. 

* Country
* Site
* Room
