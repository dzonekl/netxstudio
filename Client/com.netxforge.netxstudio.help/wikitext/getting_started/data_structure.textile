h1. Data Structure and principles

The system data structure consists of the following items: 

* Library
* Operator(s)
* Services
* Metrics
* Geo

h2. Library

The resource library is the base data of the system. It defines the Telecommunications representation of system and it's characteristics. 

It is the primary starting point to use NetXStudio and is populated in the Library Task.

The following objects are defined in the Library.  

* Network Element Type
* Function
* Equipment
* Company
* Tolerance
* Unit
* Expression
* Resource
* Metric

In the diagram below, as an example we provide a definition of a system named as  MSC-S. 

# The objects highlighted in Yellow, represent objects in the Network
# The objects highlighted in Purple, represent objects in the Library

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Function
* Equipment


h3. Metric

A metric is an identifier with a name which refers to a statistics counter produced by a telecommunication equipment 
vendor. Metrics should be defined for each relevant capacity metric required to be monitored. A Metric is referenced by 
a metric source. 

h3. Resource

Resource contain various so-called ranges, which store information about the resource. 
These are: 

* Multiple Metric Ranges

* Capacity Range

* Utilization Range

!PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/img/getting_started/resource_structure.png!

Metric ranges are created when reading metrics from the defined sources. A metric source 
will tell for each metric and corresponding resource the characteristics of the metric being stored in the resource. 
The characteristics are: 

- Are these Average or Busy Hour values, identified as AVG and BH
- What is the interval of measurement in minutes. I.e an interval of '60' means an interval of one hour between each measurement. 

Example: 

For a metric which produces hourly busy hour value, the following metric range will be created in the resource. 

METRIC BH 60 (This is actually the syntax used by the NetXScript expression grammar).

h3. Metric vs Resource what is the difference? 

It can be confusing the see the difference between a metric and a resource. 
The difference should be become clear considering the following. 

A Resource is holding the values of a metric, but also the results of calculations like the utilization or the tolerance values. In contrary a metric, is specified by the vendor of the telecommunications equipment.

A Resource is created when reading-in metric values, The name of the resource is giben the name of the metric.
A resource can however also be created manually and populated with the results from expressions. This is also referred
to as a derived resource.   


h2. Design Task

The following objects are defined in the Design Task.  

* Network
* Network Element
* Functional Relationship 
* Physical Relationship

h3. Operator

The operator, is the actual model of the Operator
 
h3. Network

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Network
* Function
* Equipment

It also holds the Functional and Physical relationships. 

h3. Network Element

The Network Element object is the instance of a Library Network Element Type.

h3. Lifecycle 

Network Elements, Equipments and Functions all have a lifecycle represented by various dates. 

* Proposed => The object creation date in the system. 
* Planned => The expected planning date, meaning confirmation that the object will be actually introduced into the network.  
* Construction => The date the object is actually constructed in reality. 
* In Service => The date the object is brought into service. 
* Out of Service => The date the object is no more in service. 

Lifecycle rules. 

The Lifecycle dates are relevant to various processes. 

* Objects have to be "In Service" to be included in the monitoring cycle.  


h3. Geographical 

* Country
* Site
* Room


h2. Services and Monitoring

A Service consists of a Network elements, service users and Tolerance expressions determining the RAG status of a service. 
Service can be nested, so can consist of other services. 

Monitoring is executed on two levels, first on resource level and then on service level.
Resource Monitoring is the process of calculating resource capacity, utilization and tolerance markers over a certain period. 

For each monitoring period, a Service Monitoring object is created which consists of one or more Resource Monitors. 
Resource Monitors refer to a single resource. 

A Marker is a reference to a value in one of the Metric ranges, and of a certain type of event. 
The following event types exist: 

* Tolerance Crossed
* Internal Event
* External Event
* Action Needed. 

_Note:_ In the monitoring phase, only tolerance crossed markers are supported. Other markers are intended for the forecasting
and expansion process. 

h3. Tolerance-crossed event. 

In the monitoring process, the Tolerance levels for each resource are calculated with the tolerance expressions. 
From this tolerance crossed markers are determined. A Tolerance marker is one of the following: 

* Start => A marker indicating the start of a monitoring period. 
* Up => A tolerance is crossed going up. 
* Down => A tolerance is crossed going down. 

A tolerance-crossed marker also contains a reference to the tolerance level for which the marker applied. 
The result of this analysis is a list of markers as depicted in the diagram here: 

!PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/img/getting_started/monitoring_markers.png!

h3. Red, Amber & Green (RAG) status 

The RAG status is the status of a service and corresponding Network Elements and resources in a certain period.

For a resource, we have seen that a list of markers is produced for a certain period. The RAG status of a resource there for reflects the markers for this period. The current rule is that a resource is: 

* RED => the resource started or crossed the RED tolerance level during the period.
* AMBER => the resource started or crossed the AMBER tolerance level during the period. 
* GREEN => the resource doesn't start or crosses the AMBER or RED level during the period. 


_Note:_ The RAG status of a network element corresponds to the RAG status of it's resources. i.e. if one of it's resources is RED, the NE will be RED as well.  (It's currently not possible to define specific rules for the RAG status of a Network Element).  


For a service, the RAG status can be determined by applying a specific rule. 
The rule can be i.e. the number of Network Elements in status AMBER can't be > 3. 
Service Tolerance rules are defined as Tolerance expressions and attached to a Service. 

h3. The monitoring period rules. 

The monitoring period is automatically calculated when a monitoring job is scheduled to run at a certain date and time. 
the period starts at the point of the last monitoring period and ends at the point in time when the monitoring period is initiated. 
When the monitoring for a service runs for the first time, the period goes back 6 months.
