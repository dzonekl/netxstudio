h1. Data Structure

The system data structure consists of the following items: 

* Library
* Operator(s)
* Services
* Metrics
* Geo

h2. Library

The resource library is the base data of the system. It defines the Telecommunications representation of system and it's characteristics. 

It is the primary starting point to use NetXStudio and is populated in the tasks: [TODO, reference to these tasks. ]

The following objects are defined in the Library.  

* Function
* Equipment
* Metric
* Company
* Tolerance
* Unit
* Expression
* Resource

In the diagram below, as an example we provide a definition of a system named as  MSC-S. 

# The objects highlighted in Yellow, represent objects in the Network
# The objects highlighted in Purple, represent objects in the Library

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Function
* Equipment
* Metric

h3. Metric

A metric is an identifier with a name which refers to a statistics counter produced by a telecommunication equipment 
vendor. Metrics should be defined for each relevant capacity metric required to be monitored. A Metric is referenced by 
a metric source. 

h3. Resource

Resource contain various so-called ranges, which store information about the resource. 
These are: 

* Multiple Metric Ranges

* Capacity Range

* Utilization Range

* Multiple Tolerance Ranges

[TODO diagram showing the various ranges. ]

!PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/img/getting_started/resource_structure.png!


[TBD various other ranges related to trending, forecasting etc...]

Metric ranges are created when reading metrics from the defined sources. A metric source 
will tell for each metric and corresponding resource the characteristics of the metric being stored in the resource. 
The characteristics are: 

- Are these Average or Busy Hour values, identified as AVG and BH
- What is the interval of measurement in minutes. I.e an interval of '60' means an interval of one hour between each measurement. 

Example: 

For a metric which produces hourly busy hour value, the following metric range will be created in the resource. 

METRIC BH 60 (This is actually the syntax used by the NetXScript expression grammar).

h3. Metric vs Resource what is the difference? 

It can be confusing the see the difference between a metric and a resource. 
The difference should be become clear considering the following. 

A Resource is holding the values of a metric, but also the results of calculations like the utilization or the tolerance values. In contrary a metric, is specified by the vendor of the telecommunications equipment.

A Resource is created when reading-in metric values, The name of the resource is giben the name of the metric.
A resource can however also be created manually and populated with the results from expressions. This is also referred
to as a derived resource.   


h2. Operator

The operator, is the actual model of the Operator

The following objects are defined in the Network.  

* Network
* Node
* Functional Relationship 
* Physical Relationship
* [TBD update with the latest model details]

The Node object is the instance of a Library Function and Equipment. (Each Node, has a root Function and root Equipment).
It also holds the Functional and Physical relationships. 

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Network



h2. Geographical

The following objects are currently also defined for the network, but not in use. 

* Country
* Site
* Room


h2. Other Data (File based) 


* NetXStudio Excel template (.xml or .xls Excel Spreadsheet). 
* NetXStudio model files. (.netxstudio)
* NetXStudio model transformations (.qvto)
* NetXStudio model reports (.html)
