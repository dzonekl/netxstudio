h1. Data Structure

The system data structure consists of the following items: 

* Library
* Operator(s)
* Services
* Metrics
* Geo

h2. Library

The resource library is the base data of the system. It defines the Telecommunications representation of system and it's characteristics. 

It is the primary starting point to use NetXStudio and is populated in the tasks: [TODO, reference to these tasks. ]

The following objects are defined in the Library.  

* Function
* Equipment
* Metric
* Company
* Tolerance
* Unit
* Expressions

In the diagram below, as an example we provide a definition of a system named as  MSC-S. 

# The objects highlighted in Yellow, represent objects in the Network
# The objects highlighted in Purple, represent objects in the Library

!PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/img/getting_started/library_structure.png!

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Function
* Equipment
* Metric


h2. Operator

The operator, is the actual model of the Operator

The following objects are defined in the Network.  

* Network
* Node
* Functional Relationship 
* Physical Relationship
* [TBD update with the latest model details]

The Node object is the instance of a Library Function and Equipment. (Each Node, has a root Function and root Equipment).
It also holds the Functional and Physical relationships. 

The following objects can be nested to provide the needed representation of a Telecommunications System. 

* Network


h2. Metrics

[TBD]


h2. Geographical

The following objects are currently also defined for the network, but not in use. 

* Country
* Site
* Room


h2. Other Data (File based) 


* NetXStudio Excel template (.xml or .xls Excel Spreadsheet). 
* NetXStudio model files. (.netxstudio)
* NetXStudio model transformations (.qvto)
* NetXStudio model reports (.html)
