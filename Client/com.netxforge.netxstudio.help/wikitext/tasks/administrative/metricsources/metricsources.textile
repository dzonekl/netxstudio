h2. Metric Source types.

There are two type of collections: 

* File based metric collections
* DB based metric collection.

h3. File based

For file based collections, the Metric Source will contain a path on the file system of the server, which is 
scanned for files. 

h3. Database based. 

For DB based collections, the Metric Source will contain Database connection information and a query
to be executed.

h2. Metric Source Job

A metric source can be scheduled for collection or it can be collected immediately. 

*Schedule Collection Job* => Right-click on a Metric Source in the table and select *Schedule Collection Job...*

_See_ "Create or Modify a a collection job":PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/html/tasks/administrative/jobs/mapping_statistics.html


*Collect Now* => Right-click on a Metric Source in the table and select *Collect Now...*

NOTE: for a DB connection, we will by default collect the last 7 days. 

*Statistics* => Right-click a Metric Source in the table and select  *Statistics...*

h2. Mapping

Mapping is the process of identifying information from a data source which contains metrics, and how this maps into the NetXStudio data model. 

The mapping parameters are: 

* DateTime - Date and time of the measurement
* Date  - Date of the measurement
* Time - Time of the measurement
* Interval - The applicable measurement interval for the metric
* Metric - The actual metric we are trying to map. (Note: The metric must have been defined). 
* Identifier - The identifier which should be used to map the metric.  

The following identifiers are defined, and the attribute on which mapping of text should occur. 

* NODE 
** Node ID
* EQUIPMENT
** Name
** Equipment Code
** Position
* FUNCTION
** Name
* RELATIONSHIP
** Name
** Protocol

Mappings can be made to collect metrics from the following types: 

* XLS Mapping - Map metric information from an Excel spreadsheet file . 
* CSV Mapping - Map metric information from a Comma Separated Value file.
* DB Mapping - Map metric information from a Database 

Typically a mapping will contain one of the Date / Time parameters, one or several metrics and several identifiers. 

If the mapping is successful a Resource will be created and populated with the metric values.
