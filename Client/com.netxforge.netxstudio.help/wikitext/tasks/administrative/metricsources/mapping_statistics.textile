h2. Selecting a folder scan run

On the left a list of statistics for each run is presented. Selecting a run will 
present more information on the right side of the screen. The following is presented. 

*Status* => A message generated by the server. I usually contains which files were processed. 

*Total Rows Processed* => The number of rows which were processed for this run.

*Start Date/Time* => The date and time of the run start. 

*End Date/Time* => The date and time of the run end.

When errors occurred, another table is populated containing each error. Note that a 
Metric Source could contain several metrics to import. For each failed metric there will be a 
line with information on what failed.

Right to the title of the screen, a menu can be selected named "Clean Up...".
