h2. Tolerance 


Tolerances can be defined and associated with resources belonging to a Function or Equipment. 
For each of the required tolerance levels. (Red, Amber, Green, Yellow) a tolerance definition should be 
created, including the expression to calculate the tolerance value. A tolerance definition can be re-used across an arbitrary number of functions and equipments. 

When a monitoring job executes for a Service and subsequently a Network Element, the tolerance definitions will be used in the following way. 

* For each Tolerance in the Function / Equipment execute the expression and write the result in 
the tolerance range of each resource corresponding to the Tolerance level. 

* For each resource compare each tolerance level against the actual utilization. Create a marker if the value is crossed. 

_Example:_ 

The following Tolerance definitions: 

|_. Name |_.Level|_.Expression|
|SGSN Attached Capacity exceeded |Red|"this TOLERANCE 60 = this CAP 60 * 0.9;"|
|SGSN Attached Capacity warning|Amber|"this TOLERANCE 60 = this CAP 60 * 0.7;"|
|SGSN Attached Capacity sufficient|Green|"this TOLERANCE 60 = this CAP 60 * 0.5;"|
|SGSN Attached Capacity under utilized|Yellow|"this TOLERANCE 60 = this CAP 60 * 0.3;"|

When associated with a Function / Equipment, the resources will be compared against the result from 
the Tolerance expressions.
