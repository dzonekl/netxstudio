h1. Expressions

The Expressions screen provides access to all expressions used by the system. 
Expressions can be created and attached to various to objects. From the expressions screen the following activities can be performed

* "Create or Modify an Expression":PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/html/tasks/library/expressions/creating_an_expression.html


The Expressions screen

*New* => Click on the upright link to create a new expression
*Edit* => Right-click on an expression in the table and select edit. 
*Filter* => Type text to filter expressions containing the text

h2. Types of expressions

Expressions are evaluated by the expression engine depending on the job being performed. 

* Service Monitoring
* Resource Monitoring
* Data retention

h2. Expressions in Service Monitoring

* Service Tolerance Expressions
* Service Profile Expressions

h2. Expressions in Resource Monitoring

In resource monitoring expressions are applied at various stages. Some expressions are always applied, and some are applied depending on if an object has an expression 'attached'. Attaching an expression simply means telling an object it has an expression. 

The following expressions exist

* Metric Expressions
* Capacity Expressions
* Utilization Expressions
* Tolerance Expressions


h2. Expressions in Data Retention 

In data retention, the expression is applied when the retention job, executes the extension rules. and attached expression 


h2. Applicable objects

The following objects use expressions in resource monitoring: 

* Function/Equipment Resources

Calculate Function and Equipment resource capacities using an expression

* Metric

Calculate and derive resource values from raw metrics

* Function/Equipment Thresholds

Calculate and derive threshold values.

h2. The resource monitoring job

The resource monitoring job executes the expressions in the following sequence

* Execution of the Capacity Expressions for all Network Elements. 
* Execution of the Utilization Expressions for all Resources in all Network Elements. 
* Execution of the Tolerance Expressions for all Network Elements. 

h3. Capacity Expressions 

A capacity expression, is an expression which will populate the capacity values of a resource. 
It is typically using the specification of the vendor to calculate the value of the capacity of a resource. 

Example: 

this -> RESOURCE sgsn_attached_users CAP = this.EQUIPMENT BOARD.count * 5; 

In this example for the current node the capacity values of the resource "sgsn_attached_users" will be the total of equipments with code "BOARD" multiplied by 5. In other words we count the boards of a specific type, 
multiply them by 5 and store the result in the capacity. 


h2. Expression Syntax

The expression engine scripting grammar specification has been carefully designed to support the following facilities. 

* Type (less) grammar.

* Contextual grammar. (Acts in the context of an object and period). 
* Data Model entity access (References).

* Scoping and nesting of expressions. 

* Statements
** Expression Statements
** Assignment Statements
** Compound Statements

* Operators
** Arithmetic Operations. 
** Logical Operations. 
** Binary Operations

* Functions
** Native Functions
** Defined functions

h3. Formatting Conventions

For better readability of the grammar, the following conventions are followed throughout this chapter.  

* Model types are written in capital letters i.e. NE. 
* Variable or function definitions are plain text i.e. erlang() 
* Keywords are non-capital letter with bold face. For example if
References to parts of the grammar, like an Expression Statement is enclosed with chevrons, i.e. < Expression Statement> or …

h3. Type (less) grammar

The grammar is a type less or dynamically typed grammar. This means that, when working with variables, references or function arguments, specification of the type is not needed. The type however is inferred from the value(s) of the variable or argument.

The following types are defined: 

|_. Type |_.Description|_.Possible values|
| Boolean | A Boolean value| true or false|
| Numeric | A numeric value | -1, 0.3, 5000000|
| Numeric_TS | A tuple of a numeric value with a time stamp | (153.67 , 16-01-2012 @ 01:00h) |
| Range | A collection of types | [4,5,6] or [NE1, NE2, etc..] or [V1, V2, V3]|
| Matrix | Multiple collections of types | [[V1, V2, V3], [V1,V2,V3] |

To find out the type of an object, the following syntax is used:
[TODO, Not implemented.]


h3. Contextual grammar 

* The grammar acts in the context of an object, which has to be set before a script is executed. The context Object is named: _this_

* The grammar acts in the context of a period, which has to be set before a script is executed. All values within this period will be within context when executing the script. The context period is not accessible from with the script, but used when needed by the expression interpreter. The interpreter will try to keep time stamps for values when possible, but will also determine the time stamp when a new value is calculated. i.e. simply assigning a numeric value to a resource, will require the interpreter to give this numeric value a time stamp. 


h3. Data Model entity Access

The most common objective is to store/retrieve values from resources. Resources are part of EQUIPMENT and FUNCTION.  Model access, permits the access to entities in the Data Model.

The entities which are set as context.  

* NETWORK ELEMENT
* RESOURCE

The following entities are accessed indirectly (See the examples further on). 

* METRIC
* LINK
* EQUIPMENT
* FUNCTION
* PARAMETER

[TODO, To be further considered]

* SERVICE
* SERVICEPROFILE
* SERVICEDISTRIBUTION
* RFSSERVICE

Model navigation permits, the access to some of the relevant Data Model entities. The result of model navigation can be used in statements (i.e. Expression, Assignment and Compound), where relevant.  

h4. Context access

*Description:* To access the current context object.
*Syntax:* this ...;
*Returns:* The current context object. (Either NETWORK ELEMENT, FUNCTION/EQUIPMENT and/or RESOURCE). 

h4. Access to a Function or Equipment

*Description:* To access a function or equipment. 
*Syntax:* this.FUNCTION _functionname_ / this.EQUIPMENT _equipmentcode_ ;
*Returns:* Range => The current context, and from this a function or equipment. 

h4. Access to a Resource

Resources can be accessed implicitly from the current context. 

*Description:* To access one or more resources from the implicit context.
*Syntax:* this -> RESOURCE _expressionname_ [ALL] _range_;
*Returns:* Range or Matrix => The current context, and from this one or more resource ranges.

*Options:* [ALL] => Instructs the interpreter to get all resources, also the resources with the specified _expressionname_ which could be nested beneath. 

h4. Access to a Resource value range from a NETWORK ELEMENT context.

As described in the "Data Structure":PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/html/getting_started/data_structure.html , a Resource has multiple value ranges. Value ranges can be directly addressed by the NetXScript grammar.  

*Description:* To access one or more value ranges with metric values

h4. Access to a Resource value range from a RESOURCE context.

If the context is a RESOURCE, we have direct access to each of the value ranges: 

*Description:* To access a value range with metric values 
*Syntax:* this METRIC [AVG/BH] _interval_
*Returns:* The current context (The resource) , then the metric range followed by the interval 

*options:* [AVG/BH] => The type of value range either AVG (Average) or BH (Busy Hour).


h3. Scoping and nesting of expressions

h4. Scoping 

A scope, is a partition in the grammar, which is self-contained, in practice defined variables can overlap variables in the outer scope.  
*Description:* Scoping is achieved by putting expressions and assignments in brackets {} variables defined with this scope, are only visible within that scope. 
*Syntax:* {...}

h4. Nesting

*Description:* Nested scopes are achieved by nesting the curly brackets. 
Syntax: {…{…}}

h3. Statements

Statements can be:

Expression statements
Assignment statements
Compound statements

h4. Expression Statement

*Description:* Expression results are Numeric, Boolean, Range or Object. The types of operations and operands used in an expression, will determine if the expression return type.

h4. Assignment Statement

*Description:* Assignment statements assign a value to a variable or entity attribute or reference. Type conformance is implied. 
*Syntax:* =   +=   [NOT implemented -=   *=   /=   %=] 

h4. Compound Statements

*Description:* the if … else…. Compound statement 
Syntax: 

if( <Boolean expression> ){
…
} else {
…
}

Description of the while Compound statement
Syntax:

while( <Boolean expression> ) {
…
}

h3. Operators

h4. Arithmetic Operations. 


h4. Logical Operations.

[TBD]
 
h4. Binary Operations

h3. Functions

h4. Native Functions

Native functions, are embedded in NetXScript and readily usable in expressions. Native function are applied 
to the expression preceding the native function. Native functions can be chained, feeding the next native function
with the result of the preceding one. Most functions apply to a range (or at least make sense to multiple values).


When applying native functions to a Matrix, (Multiple ranges), the function can be either applied horizontally or vertically. 

Vertically (Default). 

Ranges are grouped by time stamp first, and the native function is applied to each time stamp group and the result is returned. 


Horizontally (Currently not supported). 

Native function is applied to each range and the result is returned. 


*Syntax:* ._nativefunction_

The following native functions are available: 

*Description:* Count the number of items in the range or matrix.
*Syntax:* .count()
 
*Description:* Sum the value(s) in the range or matrix. 
*Syntax:* .sum() 
 
*Description:* The minimum value(s) in the range or matrix.
*Syntax:* .min()

*Description:* The maximum value(s) in the range or matrix.
*Syntax:* .max()

*Description:* The maximum value(s) in the range or matrix.
*Syntax:* .mean()

*Description:* The standard deviation value(s) in the range or matrix.
*Syntax:* .deviation()

*Description:* The Erlang B value(s) in the range or matrix. 
*Syntax:* erlangB()

*Description:* Clear the values in the range or matrix. 
*Syntax:* clear()';

*Returns:* Either a single value or a range of values preserving the time stamps.


h4. Defined functions

NetXScript also supports the definition of own functions. 

*Description:* Defined a function with 0 or more arguments. 
*Syntax:* def _functionName_( _argument [,argument] )
