h1. Importing

In order to easily populate the Library and Network with object data, we can use an Excel template. 
NetXStudio can generate the excel template, which can then be edited in MS Excel. When ready, the excel 
template can be imported.


h2. Structure of the excel

For each of the objects from the Library and Network. we define a separate excel tab.
We also define tabs which will be used to define the relationships between objects. 
The name of the relationship tabs end with <pre>"_refs"</pre> as in <pre>"references"</pre> 

h3. Object tabs

Object tabs contain two header rows. 

* Attribute header row
* Type header row

The Attribute header row, defines the name of an attribute which can be defined.
There are various types of attribute headers:
 
# Blue attributes - Define a value
# Brown attributes - Define a reference to another Object from Type.
# Black attributes - Define a contained reference to another Object from Type.

The Values filled-in the attributes which are reference (or contained reference) should
be the identifier for the referenced object. 

(TODO, the identifiers are not set in the model, but defined by the parser of the excel, 
we need an inventory of these identifiers. ) 

The type header row, defines the type an attribute. The types are either other objects from
the data structure, enumerated values or standard types:

h3. Enumerated Values

(TODO, these will change, why not generate these in the excel as well)

h3. Standard Types 

* AnyURI => Valid URI (See RFC TODO, what is the rfc number). 
* Name100 => max 100 characters
* Description2000 => max 2000 characters
* String => max 255 characters
* ExpressionLine => max 255 characters [TODO Check if this is correct]
* Boolean => 'y' or 'n'
* Int => Integer value 


h2. Example

In the figure below, we can see for the Metric object the following attributes and types. 

* Description 
* MeasurementPoint 
* MetricCalculation
* Name.
* MeasurementKind
* unitRef

Now we can simply populate this object, with information from the vendor:
