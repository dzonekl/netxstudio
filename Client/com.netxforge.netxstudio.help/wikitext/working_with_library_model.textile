h1. Working with file based Library models and the Database

A Library model can exist as independent files name .netxstudio or it can exist in the Database. 

The working procedure is to create one or more  .nextStudio first and then consolidating these into a single .netxstudio 
, which is then loaded in the Database. 

The editors in NetXStudio can work with both .netxstudio and the Database Library Model.

The following working procedure is recommended: 

# Create one or more file based Library Models for various equipment. 
# Consolidate the file based library models into one single model. 
# Load the Database with the consolidated file based library model.



h1. Working with the Database

NetXStudio uses a back-end database to persist the Library model, but also collected metrics from OSS systems. 
The Database is installed together with the NetXStudio application. 

When starting NetXStudio, the Database is not connected. To connect to the Database: 

* Select File-> DB -> Connect



h2. Loading the Database with a library model. (WARNING, will erase the DB!). 

To load the Database, select a .netxstudio model, right-click select Import. 
A wizard will open which looks like this: 

!PLUGINS_ROOT/com.netxforge.netxstudio.help/img/import_wizards.png!

Select the wizard named: "DB Import" and press "Next". The following page will allow to select a different file, 
but pressing "Finish" should now start the import.
