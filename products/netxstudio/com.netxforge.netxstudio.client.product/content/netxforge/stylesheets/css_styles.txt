Introduction
------------

Styles are brocken up by the functionality provided to keep
the site maintainable. 
We identiy two types of styles: 

1. Generic styles

There should be one of these. It defines all styles which are
generic for the whole site. Think of <body> etc.. 

2. Functional styles

Functional styles are specific to each function. It's the objective to
not overlap functional layout styles with generic styles. 

As we borrow styles, we need to cleaned the borrowed styles so we only 
keep the relevant parts.

Note on styles
--------------

IE and MOZILLA/FIREFOX have a different interpretation of the W3C standard
on using the padding attribute. For this we don't use the padding attribute.
Instead we specify a content style, with a margin which has the desired 
effect to create space between the box borders and the content.

Transparency
filter: alpha(opacity=40);
filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(opacity=40);
-moz-opacity: 0.40; opacity:0.4;
