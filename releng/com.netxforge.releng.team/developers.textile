h1. Hold Team Project Set. 

h2. To use 

* Download Eclipse and launch it in a fresh workspace. 
** Eclipse can be downloaded from "here":http://www.eclipse.org
** Setup the target platform

The Target Platform (TP) is the dependencies for which the code will be compiled against. 
By default the TP is all the plugins which come with the download. For NetXForge, we have published
the dependencies to make sure we always use the same one. 




* Add a GIT repository (NetXForge GIT URL). 




* Checkout the repo projects into the Workspace. 

Checkout what you need to change.
