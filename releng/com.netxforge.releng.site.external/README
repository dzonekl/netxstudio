External Component P2 Site
==========================

This releng component is intended to build a P2 for externally referenced components.

The site is used by products to resolve dependencies in the build process. 
(So .rmap of product components should have locators for the this site). 

The import, refers many different external components. 
Revisions are controlled by revision dependencies in the included features of the root component. ( feature.xml)
but also what is available trough the resource map (site.rmap), if a referenced component with revision x.y. is not found 
the import will fail, and the P2 site will not be created. 

Some components are in our own Github repository, when not available from a public provider. (Public p2 update site or 
other). By default buckminster will try to build these packages.
